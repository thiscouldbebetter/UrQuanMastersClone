#(ARE_YOU_THE_RESUPPLY_SHIP)
Are you the resupply ship?
I can't tell: our sensors are on the fritz.
It's not just the sensors, either.
We are almost out of EVERYTHING,
and that includes oxygen, by the way.
We need refueling, and we need it now.
I repeat: are you the Empire resupply ship?
Where have you guys BEEN all this time?

#(NO_WERE_NOT_THE_RESUPPLY_SHIP)
We're not the resupply ship.

#(YES_WE_ARE_THE_RESUPPLY_SHIP)
Yes, we're the resupply ship.

#(WE_NEED_RADIOACTIVES)
What did you say?
Sorry, I can't make out what you're saying.
Our antenna array took a micrometeor last month,
and there's been no parts to rebuild it.
We keep fixing it, and it keeps breaking.
Look, it doesn't matter.
Whoever you are, we need help, badly.
If you're receiving this, PLEASE,
bring us some radioactives for our reactor.
I swear we'll make it worth your while...
...somehow or other.

#(ILL_GET_YOU_RADIOACTIVES)
We're leaving now to find the fuel you need.

#(I_WONT_GET_YOU_RADIOACTIVES)
We aren't running any errands for beggars.

#(TRANSFER_RADIOACTIVES)
[Transfer the radioactives.]

#(PLEASE_JUST_BRING_US_RADIOACTIVES)
If you're saying something, I can't hear you.
Just please, bring us the radioactives we need.
Any amount at all would be enough for us right now.

#(HAVE_YOU_BROUGHT_THE_RADIOACTIVES)
You're back.
Have you brought the radioactives we need?

#(YES)
Yes.

#(NO)
No.

#(HURRY_UP_WITH_THE_RADIOACTIVES)
Please hurry, we desperately need them.

#(IF_YOU_HAVE_RADIOACTIVES_TRANSFER_THEM)
Did you say yes?
If you have them, can you transfer them over?

#(RADIOACTIVES_RECEIVED_SYSTEMS_RESTORED_WHO_ARE_YOU_REALLY)
We're receiving the radioactives now.
Our technicians will load them into the reactor immediately.
We should be back online in moment or two...
...stand by...
...ah, there we are.  Sensors are powering up now.
I should be able to see your ship in a... few...
...uh...
...okay, you're sure as hell not the Empire resupply ship.
So who ARE you?

#(IM_FROM_THE_COALITION)
I'm from the Freedom Coalition.

#(NEVER_MIND_WHO_I_AM)
Never mind who I am.  You promised me your help.,

#(THE_COALITION_DOESNT_EXIST_ANYMORE)
The Freedom Coalition?  That hasn't existed for 20 years.

#(WE_GOT_SHIPWRECKED)
We got shipwrecked during the war, and have been hiding out.

#(WHAT_ARE_YOU_DOING_HERE_NOW)
Oh.  Well, what are you doing here now?

#(WE_RECENTLY_FOUND_THIS_SHIP)
We recently built--well, found, really--this ship.

#(WHAT_DO_YOU_WANT_FROM_US)
I see.  And what do you want from us?

#(I_WANT_YOU_TO_HELP_FIGHT_THE_LAHKEMUP)
I want you to help me bring down the Lahk-emup Empire.

#(I_SEE)
I... see.

#(YOU_NEED_MORE_THAN_ONE_SHIP)
You know, I used to have dreams, too.
But you'd need a whole lot more than one ship
to take on the Lahk-emup.
The Coalition had a whole fleet,
thousands of ships,
and we still lost the war.

#(I_GUESS_WE_OWE_YOU)
Well, in any case, I guess we owe you.

#(HOW_CAN_WE_HELP)
What can we do to help?

#(THIS_STATION_OFFERS_THESE_SERVICES)
This station has mineral and salvage refineries,
hyperspace fuel formularies,
and shipyards and ship component factories.
What we don't have, though, is raw materials,
so you'll need to bring us resources,
like minerals or salvage,
before we can make anything of value.
Also, we have far more crew than we strictly need,
some of whom might be itching for a berth on your ship
after the last couple decades of enslavement.
So:

#(WHAT_CAN_WE_DO_FOR_YOU_TODAY)
What can we do for you today, captain?"

#(I_HAVE_MINERALS)
I have some raw materials for processing.

#(I_NEED_FUEL)
I'd like to buy some fuel.

#(I_NEED_REPAIRS)
I'd like to get my ship refitted.

#(I_NEED_CREW)
I'd like to hire some crew.

#(I_NEED_INFORMATION)
I'd like some information, please.

#(IM_LEAVING_NOW)
"Nothing, commander.  See you later.

#(VISIT_THE_DOCKS)
That can be taken care of at the docks.
You can use them at any time simply by visiting the station.

#(I_HAVE_NO_INFORMATION_RIGHT_NOW)
I don't have any information right now.
Come back later.

#(GOODBYE)
Fair sailing and good hunting, captain.
