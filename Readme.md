Ur-Quan Masters Clone
=====================

The code in this repository is eventually intended to reproduce all the basic functionality of the engine for the game _Ur-Quan Masters_, also known as _Star Control 2_.  The reimplementation will use JavaScript and an existing game framework available at the URL "https://github.com/thiscouldbebetter/GameFramework".

To minimize the possibility of legal entanglements, this repository will not contain any actual content files from the game, nor any other third-party copyrighted information.  Note this content is currently available at the URL "https://git.code.sf.net/p/sc2/uqm".  This repository may eventually provide a mechanism to import some of this content into a format that can be run via this engine.
